        <h1>One Year Transformation: From Barren to Thriving</h1>

        <p>When I first arrived at what would become Finca Limón, the land was a testament to decades of intensive cattle ranching. The soil was compacted, the biodiversity minimal, and the landscape dominated by invasive grasses that offered little ecological value.</p>
        
        <h2>The Placenta Project</h2>
        <p>Our "Placenta" project - a 400m² test plot - has become the heart of our regenerative agriculture experiment. Named for its role as the life-giving center of our farm's rebirth, this area has shown us what's possible when we work with nature rather than against it.</p>
        
        <h2>What We've Achieved</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Over 100 different species planted</li>
            <li>60+ species successfully established</li>
            <li>Visible soil improvement through composting and mulching</li>
            <li>Increased bird and insect activity</li>
            <li>First harvests of turmeric, ginger, and leafy greens</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The transformation has been remarkable. Where once there was bare, hard-packed earth, we now see a thriving ecosystem beginning to take shape. Native birds have returned, beneficial insects are proliferating, and the soil is becoming rich and dark with organic matter.</p>
        
        <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
        <p>This first year has taught us the importance of patience, observation, and working with natural cycles. Not every plant succeeded, but each failure taught us something valuable about our microclimate, soil conditions, and the delicate balance of our emerging ecosystem.</p>
        
        <p>The journey from degraded land to productive, biodiverse farm is just beginning, but the progress in this first year gives us tremendous hope for what's to come.</p>
