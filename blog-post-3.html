        <img src="blog-harvest.jpg" alt="First harvest from Finca Limón">
        
        <p>After months of careful planning, planting, and nurturing, Finca Limón celebrated its first successful harvests. This milestone represents not just agricultural success, but the beginning of our mission to provide fresh, sustainable produce to the Santa Teresa community.</p>
        
        <h2>What We Harvested</h2>
        <p>Our inaugural harvest included a variety of crops that have adapted beautifully to our Costa Rican climate and regenerative growing methods:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lemon</strong> - Aromatic and full of zesty freshness—the heart and name of my farm</li>
            <li><strong>Turmeric</strong> - Vibrant orange roots with incredible anti-inflammatory properties</li>
            <li><strong>Ginger</strong> - Fresh, aromatic rhizomes perfect for culinary and medicinal uses</li>
            <li><strong>Leafy Greens</strong> - Lettuce, kale, and spinach grown without synthetic chemicals</li>
            <li><strong>Herbs</strong> - Basil, cilantro, and other culinary herbs</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Community Connection</h2>
        <p>From day one, our vision has been to serve the vibrant Santa Teresa community. We're proud to now be supplying fresh, locally-grown produce to several restaurants and private chefs who share our commitment to quality and sustainability.</p>
        
        <p>The response from local chefs has been overwhelmingly positive. They appreciate not only the exceptional quality and freshness of our produce but also the story behind it - knowing that their ingredients are grown using regenerative methods that actually improve the land.</p>
        
        <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
        <p>This first harvest is just the beginning. As our food forests mature and our soil continues to improve, we anticipate increasingly diverse and abundant harvests. Our goal is to become a reliable source of premium, sustainable produce for the entire Santa Teresa region.</p>
        
        <p>Every vegetable, fruit, herb and root represents a step toward our vision of a regenerated landscape that feeds both people and the planet.</p>
