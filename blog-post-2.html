        <p>One of the most innovative aspects of our regenerative agriculture approach at Finca Limón has been the implementation of Black Soldier Fly (BSF) composting. This system has revolutionized our waste management while creating valuable resources for our farm.</p>
        
        <h2>The System in Action</h2>
        <p>Our BSF composting system efficiently processes kitchen scraps, garden waste, and organic matter that would otherwise go to waste. The larvae consume this organic material, breaking it down into nutrient-rich compost while simultaneously growing into protein-rich food for our chickens.</p>
        
        <h2>Benefits We've Observed</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>90% reduction in organic waste going to landfill</li>
            <li>High-quality compost production for soil amendment</li>
            <li>Protein-rich larvae for chicken feed supplementation</li>
            <li>Closed-loop system supporting circular economy principles</li>
            <li>Reduced dependency on external inputs</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The black soldier fly larvae are incredibly efficient, processing organic waste up to 10 times faster than traditional composting methods. The resulting compost is rich in nutrients and perfect for our vegetable gardens and fruit trees.</p>
        
        <h2>Preparing for Chickens</h2>
        <p>As we prepare to introduce our first 100 chickens to the farm, the BSF system will play a crucial role in providing supplemental protein. The larvae are an excellent source of amino acids and can significantly reduce our feed costs while maintaining high nutritional standards.</p>
        
        <p>This innovative composting system exemplifies our commitment to working with natural cycles and creating regenerative systems that benefit both the environment and our farm's productivity.</p>
